## 📝 What You Need to Replace

### Step 1: Get Your AdSense Publisher ID

1. **Apply for Google AdSense** at https://www.google.com/adsense
2. After approval, go to your AdSense dashboard
3. Navigate to **Account** → **Account Information**
4. Copy your **Publisher ID** (format: `ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`)

### Step 2: Replace Publisher ID in Header

**File:** `index.html` (around line 21)

**Find this:**
```html
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-YOUR-ADSENSE-ID"
     crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

**Replace:** `YOUR-ADSENSE-ID` with your actual Publisher ID

## 🔧 How to Get Ad Slot IDs

After AdSense approval, you have TWO options:

### Option 1: Use Auto Ads (Recommended for Beginners) ⭐

**This is the EASIEST option!**

1. In AdSense dashboard, go to **Ads** → **Overview**
2. Toggle **Auto ads** to ON
3. Select your website
4. Click **Apply to site**
5. You're done! Google automatically optimizes ad placement

**If using Auto Ads:** You can leave the `data-ad-slot` attributes as `YOUR-AD-SLOT-ID` or remove them entirely. Auto Ads will handle everything!

### Option 2: Manual Ad Units (More Control)

1. In AdSense dashboard, go to **Ads** → **By ad unit**
2. Click **+ New ad unit**
3. Choose ad type (Display, In-feed, etc.)
4. Name it (e.g., "Homepage - After Hero")
5. Click **Create**
6. Copy the **Ad Slot ID** (10-digit number)
7. Paste it into your HTML

**Replace in ALL 4 ad placements:**

**Find:**
```html
data-ad-client="ca-pub-YOUR-ADSENSE-ID"
data-ad-slot="YOUR-AD-SLOT-ID"
```

**Replace with your values:**
```html
data-ad-client="ca-pub-1234567890123456"
data-ad-slot="1234567890"
```

## 📍 Where to Make Changes

All ad placements are clearly marked in `index.html`:

```html
<!-- AdSense Ad Placement 1: After Hero Section -->
<!-- AdSense Ad Placement 2: Between Services and Pricing -->
<!-- AdSense Ad Placement 3: In About Section -->
<!-- AdSense Ad Placement 4: Before Contact Section -->
```

### Quick Search and Replace

1. Open `index.html` in your text editor
2. **Find:** `ca-pub-YOUR-ADSENSE-ID`
3. **Replace All:** with your actual Publisher ID
4. **Find:** `YOUR-AD-SLOT-ID`  
5. **Replace:** with your Ad Slot IDs (or leave as-is if using Auto Ads)
