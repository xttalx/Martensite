## üöÄ Next Steps: Adding Google AdSense

### ‚úÖ AdSense Code Already Added!

**Good news:** I've already added all the AdSense code to your website! You just need to replace the placeholder IDs.

### Step 1: Apply for Google AdSense

1. Go to [Google AdSense](https://www.google.com/adsense)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Get Started"
4. Enter your website URL: `www.martensite.ca`
5. Submit your application

### Step 2: Replace Your AdSense ID

Once approved, replace the placeholder ID with your real AdSense Publisher ID:

**Location:** `index.html` (line ~21)

**Find this:**
```html
<!-- Google AdSense -->
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-YOUR-ADSENSE-ID"
     crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

**Replace:** `YOUR-ADSENSE-ID` with your actual Publisher ID (e.g., `1234567890123456`)

üìå **For detailed instructions, see `ADSENSE-CONFIGURATION.md`**

### Step 3: Ad Placements (Already Done! ‚úÖ)

**I've already added 4 strategic ad placements to your website:**

1. **After Hero Section** - Catches attention immediately
2. **Between Services & Pricing** - Natural content break
3. **About Section Sidebar** - Sidebar engagement
4. **Before Contact Form** - Pre-footer placement

All placements are responsive and mobile-optimized!

### Step 4: Choose Your Ad Strategy

You have two options:

#### Option A: Auto Ads (Easiest - Recommended) ‚≠ê

**Just replace your Publisher ID and you're done!**

1. In your AdSense dashboard, go to **Ads** > **Overview**
2. Turn on **Auto ads**
3. Select your site
4. Click "Apply to site"

With Auto Ads, Google automatically optimizes ad placement. You can keep the manual placements I added OR remove them - Auto Ads works either way!

#### Option B: Manual Ad Units (More Control)

Use the 4 ad placements I already added:

1. Create ad units in AdSense dashboard
2. Get Ad Slot IDs for each placement
3. Replace `YOUR-AD-SLOT-ID` in the code (appears 4 times)

## üîß Cookie Consent Integration

The cookie consent banner is already integrated. When users accept cookies, you can initialize AdSense:

**Location in code:** `scripts/main.js` - line 430

```javascript
// Accept cookies
acceptBtn.addEventListener('click', function() {
    localStorage.setItem('cookieConsent', 'accepted');
    cookieConsent.classList.remove('show');
    console.log('Cookies accepted');
    // Here you would initialize Google AdSense or other tracking
});
```

To only show ads to users who accepted cookies, modify this to:

```javascript
// Accept cookies
acceptBtn.addEventListener('click', function() {
    localStorage.setItem('cookieConsent', 'accepted');
    cookieConsent.classList.remove('show');
    
    // Initialize AdSense after consent
    if (typeof adsbygoogle !== 'undefined') {
        (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
    }
});
```
